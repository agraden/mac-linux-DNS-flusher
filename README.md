# DNS cache flusher script for macOS

This is an executable shell script made for macOS systems. 

## Why clearing your DNS cache is good practice
Clearing your Mac's DNS cache is an essential aspect of ensuring the stability and security of your network. As you use your device, the cache accumulates information, and over time, this information can become outdated or even corrupted. This can result in connectivity issues and impede your ability to access the websites you need. Also malicious communications may take advantage of these vulnerabilities to redirect your browser to phishing schemes or other malicious sites. By flushing your DNS cache, you reduce these risks and guarantee a secure, reliable browsing experience.
