# DNS cache flusher script for Unix-based systems

This is an executable shell script made for macOS systems and should also work in Linux. 

## Why clearing your DNS cache is good practice
Clearing your DNS cache is an essential aspect of ensuring the stability and security of your network. As you use your device, the cache accumulates information, and over time, this information can become outdated or even corrupted.

## If the script does not automatically run when launched
1.  Open terminal and `cd` to the directory where the script is saved.
2.  Run the following  to make the script executable: `chmod +x flushDNS.sh`
3.  Run the script by typing `./flushDNS.sh` in the terminal and press `Enter` or double click the file from its location (e.g. /Finder/Downloads).
